<h2> My introduction to programming </h2>

My non-CS background has become a barrier in my advancement as a developer. I have the experience but I do not have a strong understanding of the basic principles of any programming language. I want to be better so I am taking courses and reading books hoping that I can evolve to someone who writes beautiful code.
